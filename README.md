Make an App from a website
==========================

Cordova template to load a mobile optimized website and package as hybrid app for distribution through App Stores.

This IntelXDK project can be used to create an app for any mobile optimized website. The project uses Cordova APIs to package into a native app that just loads the specified website. This type of app is recommended for websites built with an app like look-and-feel, responsive, single-page-app with no external website links or redirection. 

This Cordova App template has all the necessary checks to make sure internet connection is available for making website requests. The app template also makes sure that the initial website is loading completely before displaying to the user using the Cordova InAppBrowser.
